    "description": "This homebrew mech corporation based in the Karrakin Trade Baronies features 10 mechs and their unique gear and Core Bonuses. Baronic Defense Forces frames emphasize positional control, combined arms, and reactions, rewarding Lancer battle system mastery. Pierce the heart of enemy formations with the dextrous AKRAFENA; weave through fire as the self-cooling SHOTEL; survive impossible scouting missions as the KAMPILAN; hold the line with the JIAN's experimental grenades; reinforce the line as the printer-equipped DAO; intercept enemy fire yourself as the KIEM; call in fire support from above as the AKINAKA; be the fire support as the stalwart KHANDA, a dedicated heavy gunner; rip the line in half as the KLEWANG, a repurposed cargo loader; and coordinate a NHP firing line as the CHAMBI, a mountain of an artillery duelist.",
